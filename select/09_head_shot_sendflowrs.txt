I'm not trying to offend you
Baby i never intend to
Kiss your hands backstage at the venue
Yeah
'Cause i just don't care where we are
I get butterflies every time you walk into the bedroom

Pretty eyes, you're a ten too
Put cyanide on every flower that i send you
I've never felt this way before
Now i'm sleeping on the floor
Rock bottom i'll descend to
So i'll spend a couple racks on some clothes
It makes me feel better so i'll stay here alone
Stare up at the ceiling, wonder what you're doing now girl
Stare out of the window 'cause it's still the same moon

And i shoulda crashed that car, not made it home
'Cause i'm walking on glass, i can feel it getting cold
Stare up at the ceiling, wonder what you're doing now girl
Then stare out of the window 'cause it's still the same moon

Where you off babe?
Where you running to?
Think you need to wake up, it's right in front of you yeah
It's disgusting
It's uncomfortable
I just need to smoke a blunt, stop me running loose yeah
