I graduated from Northwestern two whole years ago
I was the star there
Was the best one in the main state show
Then I moved to New York
With all of my rep and all of my pep in tow

And it's really mad and I email dad
And I lie about auditions that I haven't had
It would make me sad
But recently I isolated the thing that is bringing me down
I know what I need to work on in order to conquer this town

There's nothing like a plan
The motivation that it brings takes away the daily stings to know
Things'll be better with a better headshot
Things'll be better with a better headshot
Things'll be better with a better headshot
When I got a picture that looks like me then they'll see
That things'll be better with a better headshot
Yeah, yeah

Walk in the room and no one notices I've entered it
I clear my throat, I make a scene, I do a double split
And I try not to come off as
desperate as I desperately offer to sing elegy

And I wanna die, and the time moves slow but at least I know
Things'll be better with a better headshot
Things'll be better with a better headshot
Things'll be better with a better headshot
When I got a picture that looks like me then they'll see
Things'll be better with a better headshot
Yeah, yeah

Because the girl in that picture is scared, not me
Because the girl in that picture is blonde, not me
Because the girl in that picture ain't broken yet
By god, who's she?
Not me
And not me

So I save enough
I buy a dress
Go to a studio
I'm brave, I'm tough, I'm not a mess
A breath I walk in slow

And the woman who's taking the picture's
An out of work actress
So I up and go
And I know it's rude, but hey

Whatever, I'm just not in the mood today
I'll reschedule, it's all okay
Things will be okay
Things will be okay

Head shot
Head shot
Head shot

When I got a picture unmistakably me then they'll see, see!
Things'll be better with a better head shot
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Things'll be better with a better head shot
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Things'll be better with a better head shot
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Things'll be better with a better head shot
