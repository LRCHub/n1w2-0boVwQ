Mi know millionaire weh Neva gah school
Mi know nuff educated fool
Mi know badman weh Neva kill a man
Mi know Killa weh nuh know badman
When dem a make song, me a make bomb
When dem a gah school me a kill man
Outta yuh Ma yuh come from
Suh nuh tell me weh you par
Or weh you station, you wi get
Headshot, headshot, anybody boast, get shot
Like Jamaican economy, everything drop
Catch dem pan Di blindside, every foot flat
Headshot, headshot, be what you be, don't be what you're not, like a crumble bottle inna him head fi goh crack
Yuh fi know Sparta nuh take chat
Mi nuh retreat, me nah surrender to nuh man
So me try fi send deadly weapons
Every shot kick down any king kong
Wah you muss waah hear a yuh funeral song
Tell me, who mi fi sacrifice
So me evil, call me the take a life
Look how easy me take you out life
You a tell man fi lowwe yuh, tell you why
Headshot, headshot, anybody boast, get shot
Like Jamaican economy, everything drop
Catch dem pan Di blindside, every foot flat
Headshot, headshot, be what you be, don't be what you're not
Like a crumble bottle inna him head fi goh crack
One head alone get ten pan a shot
How mi suh evilous
And Di tasks weh me have so devious
Haffi kill Bwoy Jah Eva forgiving
A pray all day keep Di scars dem heal enuh
Dem Bwoy deh Eva well clean enuh
Cause Di Bwoy dem fi do some cleaning up
Bwoy, you coulda god or genie
Inna yuh head top bear gunshot a stuck
Headshot, headshot, anybody boast, get flat
Like Jamaican economy, everything drop
Catch dem pan Di blindside, every foot flat
Headshot, headshot, be what you be don't be what you're not
Like a crumble bottle inna him head fi goh crack
One head alone get ten pan a shot
Mi know millionaire weh Neva gah school
Mi know nuff educated fool
Mi know badman weh Neva kill a man
Mi know Killa weh nuh know bad man
When dem a make song, me a make bomb
When dem a gah school, me a kill man
Outta yuh Ma yuh come from
Suh nuh tell me weh you par or weh you station

Headshot, headshot, anybody boast get flat
Like Jamaican economy, everything drop
Catch dem pon Di blindside, every foot flat
Headshot, headshot, be what you be don't be what you're not
Like a crumble bottle inna him head fi goh crack
You fi know Sparta nuh take chat
